Hello, I am Shashwat Kedia.
I am a passionate software developer with a knack for problem-solving. I aim to shape the future of software development to make it more user-friendly and make this world a better place by correctly using technology.

I started learning software development during the pandemic (while bunking school online classes :)) and immediately fell in love with it. The entire process of going from just a concept to making it a reality is enjoyable! I take pleasure in creating an effortless user experience and designing delightful software. The most intriguing aspect of software development, according to me, is that a website or an application can pose a potential solution to a problem as big as global warming or food crisis or even predict future tsunamis!
                I always seek new opportunities for learning and cooperation on projects around interesting dashboards, design systems or landing pages. Let's create something awesome together! Other than sitting in front of my display I enjoy cricket and swimming.
